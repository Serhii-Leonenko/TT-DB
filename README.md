Create python script that:
a) loads the data from Travel Sample Bucket into csv file in pandas 
(in structured format - so it can be read in excel)
b) adds new column 'testColumn' to every record in Travel Sample Bucket 
(artificial test - if structure of data has changed in sample bucket) 
fill the column with test data
c) updates csv file created on step a). 
Update should be done in a smart way - query only the data you need, not updating full table again. 
Hint: use merge functionality in pandas.
